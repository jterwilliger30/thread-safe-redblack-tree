This is my attempt at implementing a red black tree. It works on any data structure that has defined operators of less than, greater than, and equal to.

Would like to practice
- Unique & shared pointers
- Template metaprogramming... I don't think I've ever been this frustrated with syntax before. The compiler is very picky about syntax when you have separtate header and implementation files.
- Ternary operators
-

TO DO
- Write destructors
- Benchmarks
- Unit test cases
